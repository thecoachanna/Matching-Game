# Card Matching Memory Game

In my card matching game, the player will have the ability to click on cards in order to see the hidden image. Their memory will be tested by trying to remember the location of the matching cards. The user will have won the game when all of the card matches have been found.

# Technologies Used

This project was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Problems

A stretch goal I didn't get to was adding a stopwatch to track how long it took the user to find all of the matches. The most difficult parts of this were figuring out how to shuffle the cards.

# User Stories

MVP Goals:

As a player, I want to be able to click on an image square and see the hidden image.

As a player, I want my card matches to remain unhidden so that I know how many I have left to match.
As a player, I want to know when I have found all matching pairs and won the game.

Stretch Goals:

As a player, I would like to see a timer of how long it takes me to find all matches, so that I can continue to challenge myself.
As a player, I would like a celebratory animation when I have won the game.
As a player, I would like the ability to restart the game with matches being randomized.
