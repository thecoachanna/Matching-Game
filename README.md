In my card matching game, the player will have the ability to click on cards in order to see the hidden image. Their memory will be tested by trying to remember the location of the matching cards. The user will have won the game when all of the card matches have been found.

MVP Goals:

As a player, I want to be able to click on an image square and see the hidden image.
As a player, I want my card matches to remain unhidden so that I know how many I have left to match.
As a player, I want to know when I have found all matching pairs and won the game.

Stretch Goals:

As a player, I would like to see a timer of how long it takes me to find all matches, so that I can continue to challenge myself.
As a player, I would like a celebratory animation when I have won the game.
As a player, I would like the ability to restart the game with matches being randomized.



Not much progress today due to work schedule, but will be able to Friday. Want to change images to exercises I think vs equipment.
